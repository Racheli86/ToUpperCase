# ToUpperCase

1. App:
   This Application takes a user input (type string) and returns the string so that every second letter is UpperCase. 
   Note that any user input that will contain one numeric value will ask the user to retype a text.
   
   UpperCase is the executable file.
   
2. Examples:
_____________________________________________________
   Example #1:
   Please type a text (string only): 4r4rrr
   This is a Number, please type again...
   Please type a text (string only): 44444
   This is a Number, please type again...
   Please type a text (string only): racheli
   Great!
   Now lets uppercase each 2nd letter of your text.

   Your text after uppercase is:  rAcHeLi
______________________________________________________   
   Example #2:
   Please type a text (string only): you are the best!!! wish you good luck
   Great!
   Now lets uppercase each 2nd letter of your text.

   Your text after uppercase is:  yOu aRe tHe bEsT!!! wIsH YoU GoOd lUcK
